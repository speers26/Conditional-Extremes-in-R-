R package implementing the method of [Heffernan, J.E. and Tawn, J.A., 2004. A conditional approach for multivariate extreme values (with discussion). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology, 66(3), pp.497-546.](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/66/3/497/7098439) and [Keef, C., Papastathopoulos, I. and Tawn, J.A., 2013.
